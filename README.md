**Beta Version Disclaimer**

This plugin is still being tested.  It seems pretty solid, but use it at your own risk.

## Description

SevenToon PACT (Posts As Comic Type) is intended to give you shortcodes for the chapter list and drop-down as well as order comic/chapter categories in reading order in archives. It is designed to work with the Seventoon theme, but should work with other themes, if you want to use regular posts as comics and comic/chapter categories instead of a dedicated comic management plugin.
